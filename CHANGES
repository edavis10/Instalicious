v0.2
* Updates Delicious bookmark after push, replaces "toread" tag with another tag so it won't be pushed again.
* Removed dependency on Python Delicious library. (since the Delicious update meant I had to 
do it manually anyway.)
* Added dependency on simplejson, if using Python < 2.6.

v0.1
* Basic functionality: Push "toread" from delicious to instapaper
